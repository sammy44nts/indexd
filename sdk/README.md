# The official Go SDK for the Sia Indexd API

This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the Indexd API, allowing
users to connect an application to the indexer and uploading data to as well as
users to connect an application to the indexer and upload data to and download
data from the Sia network.

The README provides a short overview to quickly get started using the SDK. For more information, please refer to the [Godocs](https://pkg.go.dev/go.sia.tech/indexd/sdk).

## Connecting to the Indexer

Before you can connect to the Indexer, you need to obtain an app password from
the Indexer UI. Afterwards, you can use the following code to connect your
application to the Indexer:

```go
resp, connected, err := sdk.Connect(ctx, "http://localhost:9982", sk, app.RegisterAppRequest{
  Name:        "MyApp",                     // The name of your application
  Description: "My first Sia application",  // A short description of your application
  LogoURL:     "https://my.app/logo.png",   // A URL to your application's logo to display in the UI
  ServiceURL:  "https://my.app/home",       // A URL to your application's homepage
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal("failed to connect app")
} else if connected {
  log.Info("app is already connected")
}

// If the app is not connected, the user needs to approve the connection by
// following the URL provided in the response.
fmt.Println("please approve app connection at the following url:", resp.ResponseURL)
connected, err := resp.WaitForApproval(ctx);
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to wait for app approval")
} else if !connected {
	log.Fatal("user denied app connection")
}
```

This code will attempt to open a browser window for the user to put in their
app password and approve the request. If the browser cannot be opened, the user
will need to manually open the URL.

## Uploading and Downloading Data

Once an application is connected, it can upload and download to and from the
network. The following is a minimal example on how to upload and download a
file using the default settings.

```go
// create the client
client, err := sdk.NewSDK("http://localhost:9982", sk)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to create SDK client", zap.Error(err))
}

// open a file to upload
srcFile, err := os.Open("path/to/src.dat")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to open the file")
}
defer srcFile.Close()

// upload the file
metadata, err := client.Upload(context.Background(), file)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to upload file")
}

// pin the uploaded object so the indexer maintains it on the network
if err := client.PinObject(context.Background(), metadata); err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to pin object")
}

// open a file to download to
dstFile, err := os.Create("path/to/dst.dat")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to open the file")
}
defer dstFile.Close()

// download the file
err = client.Download(context.Background(), dstFile, metadata)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to download file")
}
```

The `metadata` returned from the `Upload` function contains information about
the uploaded file required to download it later. Applications need to store
this information in a database or some other persistent storage.

## Packed Uploads

When uploading many small objects, using `UploadPacked` can be more efficient
than uploading each object separately. Packed uploads combine multiple objects
into shared slabs, reducing overhead and improving upload efficiency.

```go
// create a packed upload
packed, err := client.UploadPacked()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to create packed upload")
}
defer packed.Close()

// add multiple objects
for _, data := range smallObjects {
	if _, err := packed.Add(ctx, bytes.NewReader(data)); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("failed to add object")
	}
}

// finalize to get the resulting objects
objects, err := packed.Finalize(ctx)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal("failed to finalize packed upload")
}

// pin each object so the indexer maintains them on the network
for _, obj := range objects {
	if err := client.PinObject(ctx, obj); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("failed to pin object")
	}
}

// each object can be downloaded individually
for i, obj := range objects {
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	if err := client.Download(ctx, &buf, obj); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to download object %d", i)
	}
}
```

### Optimizing Packed Uploads

Use `Remaining()` and `Length()` to monitor efficiency and decide when to
finalize. This is useful when you have a stream of objects and want to avoid
excessive padding:

```go
const paddingTarget = 0.05

var uploads [][]byte
for len(uploads) > 0 {
	err := func() error {
		packed, err := client.UploadPacked()
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		defer packed.Close()

		for len(uploads) > 0 {
			_, err := packed.Add(ctx, bytes.NewReader(uploads[0]))
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			uploads = uploads[1:]

			if packed.Length() == 0 {
				continue
			}

			padding := float64(packed.Remaining()) / float64(packed.Length())
			if padding <= paddingTarget {
				break
			}
		}

		objects, err := packed.Finalize(ctx)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		// pin objects so the indexer maintains them on the network
		for _, obj := range objects {
			if err := client.PinObject(ctx, obj); err != nil {
				return err
			}
		}

		return nil
	}()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

### Limitations

- `PackedUpload` is not thread-safe; do not call `Add` concurrently
- Empty objects are not supported and will return `ErrEmptyObject`
- Once `Finalize` is called, subsequent `Add` calls return `ErrUploadFinalized`
